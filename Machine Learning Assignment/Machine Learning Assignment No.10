1)
Bayesian probability is an interpretation of the concept of probability in which instead of frequency of propensity of some phenomenon probability is interpreted as reasonable expectation representing a state of knowledge or as quantification of a personal belief.

2)
The probability of the union of two events E and F  equals the sum of the probability of E and the probability of F minus the probability of E and F occuring together.
equation=P(E∪F)=P(E)+P(F)−P(E∩F)

3)
Joint probability is a statistical measure that calculates the likelihood of two events occuring together and at the same point in time.it is the probability of two events happening together.
    P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)

4)
Chain rule calculates any component of the joint distribution of a set of random variables using only conditional probabilities.
the probability theory is used as a foundation for backpropagation and in creating Bayesian Networks.

5)
Conditional probability is defied as the likelihood of an event or outcome occurring based on the occurrence of a previous event or outcome.
Conditional probability is calculated by multiplying the probability of the preceding event by the update probability of the succeeding or conditional,event.
    P(A|B)=P(A∩B)/P(B)

6)
A continuous random variable is one which takes an infinite number of possible values.they usually measurements.
For example:Height,Weight,Time

7)
The Bernoulli distribution is a discrete probability distribution that covers a case where an event will have a binary outcomes as either a 0 or 1.
formula= f(k;p)=pk+(1-p)(1-k)

8)
Binomial distribution summarizes the number of trails,or observations when each trail has the same probability of attaining one particular value.the binomial distribution determines the probability of observing a specified number of succeessful outcomes in a specified number of trails.
formula= P(x)=nCx.px(1-p)n-x
    
9)
Poisson distribution is a discrete distribution function describing the probability that an event will occure a certain number of times in a fixed time interval.It is used to describe the distribution of rare events in large population.
formula= P(x; μ) = (e-μ) (μx) / x!

10)
Covariance is a measure of how much two random variables vary together.the covariance is a product of the units of the two variables.the value of covariance lies between -∞ and +∞. 

11)
Correlation explains how one or more variables are related to each other.these variables can be input data features which have been used to forecast our target variable.if two variables are closely correlated then we can predict one variable from other.

12)
Sampling with replacement means a data point in a drawn sample can reappear in future drawn samples as well.when a sampling unit is drawn from a finite population and is returned to that population,after its characteristics have been recorded before the next unit is drawn this is called as sampling with replacement.
example:Suppose we have the names of 5 student in hat(akshay,mayur,vivek,rakesh,vaibhav)
  choose one person's name,put the person's name back in the hat and choose another name.
  possibilities for two name samples are:akshay,mayur,mayur,akshay
        
13)
In this,each sample unit of the population has only one chance to be selected in the sample.in this the same item cannot be selected moore than once.in this method sample values are not independent.
example:Suppose we have the name of 5 students in hat(akshay,mayur,vivek,sachin,vaibhav)
        we have to choose the two samples 
        on first sample we got the name-akshay
        on second sample we got the name-mayur

14)
Hypothesis in machine learning is used when in supervised machine learning we need to find the function that best maps input to output.a hypothesis covers the complete training detaset to check the performance of the models from the hypothesis space.
example:Bacterial growth may be affected by moisture levels in the air.
