1)
A machine learning model is a file that has been trained to recognize certain types of patterns.also to train a model over a set of data, providing it an algorithm that it can use to reason over and learn from those data.
It consists of the sample output data and the corresponding sets of input data that have an influence on the output.the training model is used to run the input data through the algorithm to correlate the processed output against the sample output.

2)
The No Free Lunch Theorem is often thrown around in the field of optimization and machine learning, often with little understanding of what it means or implies.the theorem states that all optimization algorithms perform equally well when their performance is averaged across all possible problems.

3)
Cross-validation is a resampling procedure used to evaluate machine learning models on a limited data sample.the procedure has a single parameter called k that refers to the number of groups that a given data sample is to be split into.

4)
Bootstrap Sampling is a method that involves drawing of sample data repeatedly with replacement from a data source to estimate a population parameter.purpose of the bootstrap sampling is to estimate summary statistics such as the mean or standard deviation.

5)
It basically tells you how much better your classifier is performing over the performance of a classifier that simply guesses at random according to the frequency of each class.

6)
Ensemble methods is a machine learning technique that combines several base models in order to produce one optimal predictive model.to better understand this definition lets take a step back into ultimate goal of machine learning and model building.

7)
A descriptive model describes a system or other entity and its relationship to its environment.it is generally used to help specify and/or understand what the system is, what it does and how it does it.
The main purposes of descriptive models are to correctly reflect the internal data structure that allows the identification of the most important regularities and dependencies.

8)
There are 3 main metrics for model evaluation in regression:
-R Square/Adjusted R Square.
-Mean Square Error(MSE)/Root Mean Square Error(RMSE).
-Mean Absolute Error(MAE).

i)
A descriptive model will exploit the past data that are stored in databases and provide you with the accurate report.
In a Predictive model,it identifies patterns found in past and transactional data to find risks and future outcomes.
ii)
This situation where any given model is performing too well on the training data but the performance drops significantly over the test set is called an overfitting model.
On the other hand, if the model is performing poorly over the test and the train set then we call that an underfitting model.
iii)
bootstrap resamples with replacement,due to the drawing with replacement a bootstrapped data set may contain multiple instances of the same original cases and may completely omit other original cases.
cross validation resamples without replacement and thus produces surrogate data sets that are smaller than the original.these data sets are produced in a systematic way so that after a pre-specified number k of surrogate data sets each of the n original cases has been left out exactly once.this is called k-fold cross validation.

i)
LOOCV(Leave One Out Cross-Validation) is a type of cross-validation approach in which each observation is considered as the validation set and the rest (N-1) observations are considered as the training set.in LOOCV,fitting of the model is done and predicting using one observation validation set.

ii)
The F-score also called the F1-score.it is a measure of a model's accuracy on a dataset. ... The F-score is commonly used for evaluating information retrieval systems such as search engines and also for many kinds of machine learning models, in particular in natural language processing.

iii)
Silhouette refers to a method of interpretation and validation of consistency within clusters of data.the technique provides a succinct graphical representation of how well each object has been classified.the silhouette value is a measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters.the silhouette ranges from âˆ’1 to +1 where  high value indicates that the object is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters.

iv)
A receiver operating characteristic curve or ROC curve is a graphical plot that illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied.the ROC curve is created by plotting the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at various threshold settings.
