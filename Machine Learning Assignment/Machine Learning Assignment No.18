Supervised Learning:
-supervised learning algorithm are trained using labeled data.
-supervised learning needs supervision to trained the model.
-it can categorised in classification and regression problem.
-it is complex method.
-for example:Who are the unhappy customers.
    
Unsepervised Learning:
-unsupervised learning algorithm are trained using unlabeled data.
-unsepervised learning does not need any supervision to trained the model.
-it can categorised in clustering and associations problem.
-it is less complex as compare to supervised.
-for example:Finding customers segments.

2)
Application of Unsupervised Learning:
-Audience segmentation.
-Customer persona investigation.
-Anomaly detection.
-Pattern recognition.
-Inventory management.

Types of Clustering method:
i)Centroid based clustering 
when the number of clusters is fixed to k,K means clustering given a formal defination as an optimization problem.find the k clusters centre and assign the objects to the nearest cluster centre such that the squared distances from the cluster are minimized.
    
ii)Density based clustering
it is a scan method.it requires density parameters as a termination conditions.it is used to manage noise in data clusters.density based clustering is used to identify clusters of arbitary size. 
    
iii)Distribution based clustering
it can be defined as objects belonging most likely to the same distribution.a convenient property of this approach is that this closely resembles the way artificial data sets are generated by sampling random objects from a distribution.

4)
K means allocates every data point in the dataset to the nearest centroid meaning that a data point is considered to be in a particular cluster if it is closer to that cluster's centroid than any other centroid.

5)
K means attempts to minimize the total squared error while k medoids minimize the sum of dissimilaritiesbetween points labeled to be in a cluster and a point designated as the centre of that cluster.in contrast to the k means algorithm,k means chooses datapoints as centers.

6)
-a dendrogram is a diagram that shows the attributes distances between each pair of sequentially merged classes.
-After each merging the distances between all pairs of classes are updated.the distances at which the signatures of classes are merged are used to construct a dendrogram.
-the key to interpreting a dendrogram is to focus on the height at which any two objects are joined together.set the Y-axis max value.choose the set max and min value option.
-set X axis and Y axis tick number click the appearance options and from the pop up dialogue change the tick numbers.
-double click on the number label to edit numbers on X axis.

7)
SSE is sum of squared error.it is a statistical technique designed to find the best fit of consumers to a particular market segment.
-Role of SSE=   
SSE is a measure of error.the objective of K means is to try to minimize the value.the purpose of this figure is to show thst the initialization of the centroids is an important step.

8)
-Step by step procedure:
i)select the number K to decide the number of clusters.
ii)select random K points or centroids.
iii)assign each data points to their closest centroid,which will from the predefined K clusters.
iv)calculate the variance and place a new centroid of each cluster.
v)repeat the third step which means reassign each datapoint to the new closest centroid of each clusters.
vi)if any reassignment oocures then go to step 4 else go to finish.
vii)finally model is ready.

9)
single link is a method that focused on minimum distances or nearest neighbor between clusters.
complete link is concentrates on maximum distances or furthest neighbor between clusters.

10)
apriori algorithm assumes that any subset of a frequent itemset must be frequent.its the algorithm behind Market Basket Analysis.so according to the principle of Apriori.if {Grapes, Apple, Mango} is frequent, then {Grapes, Mango} must also be frequent.
