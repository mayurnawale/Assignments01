1)
It is a data analytics technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans and animals.
Machine learning algorithms use computational methods to learn information directly from data without relying on a predetermined equation as a model.
i)Machine learning application in business world:
  -Fraud detection
  -Load underwriting
  -Portfolio management
        
ii)Ethical concerns that machine learning application could raise:
  -security problems
  -Lack of trust
  -disappearence of jobs
  -Lack of quality data
  -Lack of privacy

2)
i) Under the supevision of experts:
In this method, subject matter experts accelerate the learning precess by teaching the technology in real time.it works from the bottom up by first using algorithms to conduct the heavy lifting of identifying relationship between the data and engaging humans when necessary for training or validation.due to this a amount of times a human needs to spend performing a specific task will decreases as the machine learning accuracy increases.
 
ii)With the assistance of experts in an indirect manner:
This process,in which learners initiate and advance their learning guided by more experienced parterns and socially derived sources ,such as tools,tells and other artifacts.
this process of learning as seen as been distinct from didactic instruction comprising unidirectional interaction between more and less knowledgeble interlocutors as in teaching.
in contrast the direction and process of guided learning premised more on the learners intentions,capacity and agency.

iii) Self education
Self education is a education without a guidance of masters or institute.a self education can aim to learn a little bit about everything or they work hard towards mastering in single subject.we can say that it is a act of taking your learning act in your control.it can gives a sucess to personal and financial level.

i)Supervised learning:
example:Face detection,Text categorization
ii)Unsepervised learning:
example:Customer segmentation,fraud detection,detecting defective machine parts
iii)reinforcement learning:
example:Trajectory optimisation,dynamic pathing,controller optimisation.
    
4)
various form of machine learning:
-supervised learning
-unsupervised learning
-reinforcement learning
    
5)
Well-posed learning problem is a computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to same class of tasks T and performance measure P,if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P,improves with experience E.
-Main characteristics of human learning problem:
 -Learning is growth
 -Learning is adjustment
 -Learning is intelligent
 -Learning is active
 -Learning is purposefull
    
6)
Yes,machine learning algorithm can solve all of humanity's problem.while it is undeniable that Al has opened up a welth of promising opportunities,it has also led to the emergence of a mindset that can be best described as Al solutionism.this is philosophy that given enough data machine learning algorithm can solve all of humanity's problem.

Various method and technologies for solving machine learning problems:
-Regression
-classification
-clustering
-dimensionality reduction
-ensemble methods
-deep learning
-transfer learning
-reinforcement learning
    
Regression-
In this mathematical methods that allow data scientists to predict a continuous outcome (y) based on the value of one or more predictor variables(x).linear regression is probably the most popular form of regression analysis because of its ease of use in predicting and forcasting.
Classification-
It is a preocess of categorizing a given set of data into classes.it can be performed on both structure and unstructure data.the process starts with predicting the class of given data points.the classes are often referred to as target,label or categories.

8)
various forms of supervised learning:
-Regression
example:to evaluate trends and makes estimates or forecasts in business.
    
-Classification
example:detecting spam calls
    
-Naive Bayesian Model
example:spam filtration
    
-Random forest model
example:prediction of trees 1 or 2 is apple
    
9)
In supervised learning,machine learning models are created using labeled training data.it helps predict outcomes for future data sets.
example:Face detection
In unsupervised learning their is no labels or category associated with training data.unsupervised learning allows you to discover hidden pattern within a dataset without the need of human output.
example:Fraud detection

10)
Machine learning is all about automatically learning a high accurate predictive or calssifier model or finding unknown pattern in data by leveraging learning algorithms and optimization technique.it involves taking data,examining it for patterns and developing some sort of prediction about future outcomes.it has some steps:Gathering a data,preparing that data,choosing a model,training,evaluation,hyperparameter tunning,prediction.
it has somes types :
supervised learning,unsupervised learning,reinforcement learning.

ii)Deep learning applications in helthcare:
-Drug discovery- 
In this use to analyze the patient's medical history and provides the best treatment for them and this technology is gaining insights from patient symptoms and test.
-Medical imaging-
Medical imaging techniques such as MRI scan,CT scan,ECG are used to diagnose dreadfull diseases.It helps to docter to analyze diseases better.
-Insurance fraud-
It helps to analyze the medical insurance fraud.also it helps to insurance industry to send out discount and offers to their target patient.
-Alzheimer's disease-
It is uses to detect Alzheimer at very early stage.
-Genome-
This technique is use to understand genome.This also makes docter very faster andd accurate.

iv)Linear regression(simple):
It is type of regression analysis where the number of independent variable is one and their is a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variable.the motive of the linear relationship is finds the best values for a_0 and a_1.in this result is predicted by the use of known parameter which are corelated with the outputs.

i) Generalization and abstraction
-Generalization reduces complexity by replacing multiple entities.
example:-a child who is scare by a man with a beard may fail to discriminate between beared man and generalize that all men with beards are to be feared.

-Abstraction reduces complexity by hiding irrelevant details.
example:-When we are driving a car we only concern about driving the car like start/stop the car,accelerate/break.

ii)Learning that is guided and unsupervised
-Learning that is guided is complete the task by providing training,input and output patterns to the system.

-Unsupervised learning is a self learning technique in which system has to discover the features of the input population by its own and no prior set of categories are use.unsupervised learning does not aim to produce output in response of the particular input insted it discovers the pattern.

iii)Regression and Classification:
-Regression:
Regression is the task of predicting a continuous quantity.regression may predict a discrete value,but the discrete value is in the form of an integer quantity.

-Classification:
Classification is a task of predicting a discrete class label.classification may predict a continuous value,but the continuous value is in the form of a probability for a class label.
