1)
It is a form of learning which requires higher order mental precesses like thinking,reasoning,intelligence.
Example= When we sea a dog and attach the term dog.we learn that the word dog refers to a particular animal.

-Forms of human learning:
1.classical conditioning
2.operant conditioning
3.observational learning
-Equivalents with machine learning:
1.Artificial intelligence
2.Learning theories
3.Machine learning
4.Reinforcement learning
5.Supervised learning
6.Unsupervised learning

3)
Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that allows software application to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so.
Key Responsibilities:
 -Designing ML system
 -Reserching and implementing ML algorithms and tools
 -Selecting appropriate data set
 -verifying data quality
 -Performing stastical analysis
 -Running machine learning tests
 -Training and retraining system
 -Extending machine learning libraries
 -Developing machine learning apps according to client requirements.

Rewards-Agent receives rewards for performing correctly.
Penalty-Agent receives penalties for performing incorrectly.
    
5)
The application of the machine learning is best thought of as search problem for the best mapping of inputs to outputs given the knowledge and resources available to you for a given project.
    
6)
-To make the computer smarter and more intelligent.
-To develope computational models of human learning preocess and perform computer simulation.
Human learning pattern are differnt from one person to the another.however with machine learning the learning method can easily be modified simply by chossing different algorithm.

-Speech recognition
-Medical diagnosis
-Statistical arbitrage
-Learning association 
-Classification 
-Prediction
-Extraction
-Regression

We all use an ATM for cash withdrawal,money transfer,retrieve min statement etc in our daily life.But we don't know internally what is happening inside the ATM machine when we insert ATM for any operation.

Generalization refers to your models ability to adept properly to new,previously unseen data,drawn from the same distribution as the one use to create the model.
In machine learning generalization is a defination to demonstrate how well is a trained model to classify or forecast unseen data.Training a generalised machine learning means,in general,it works for all subset of unseen data.

10)
Classification is a technique where we categorize data into a given no of classes.The main goal of classification problem is to indentify the category or class.
Main difference between classification and regression is that regression helps predict a continuous quantity while classification predicts discrete class labels.
    
11)
Regression is statistical method used in finance,investing and other disciplines that attempts to determine the strength and character of the relationship between one dependent variable and independent variable.
It produce a regression equation where the coefficient represents the relation between each dependent variable and independent variable.
Example=Businesses often use the linear regression to understand the relationship between advertising spending and revenue.

12)
Clustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group than those in other groups.In simple word the aim is to segregate groups with similar traits and assign them into clusters.

-Studing under supervision
In this algorithm target  and outcome variable are use.which is predicted from a given set of predictors.By using this set of variable we can generate a function that maps inputs and desired outputs.Training process continues untill model achieve a desired level of accuracy on the training data.
Ex:Regression,Decision tree,KNN
 
-Studing without supervision
In this we do not have any target or outcome variable to predict.This is used for clustering population in different groups,it is used for segmenting customers in different groups of specific intervention.
 ex:Apriori algorithm,K-means
