there are 4 different types of data used in machine learning.
1)Numerical data-
Numerical data represent values that can be measured and put into a logical order. Examples of numerical data are height, weight, age, number of movies watched, IQ, etc.
2)Categorical data-
Categorical variables represent types of data which may be divided into groups. Examples of categorical variables are race, sex, age group, and educational level.
3)Time-series data-
Examples of time series are heights of ocean tides, counts of sunspots.
4)Text-
online reviews, customer surveys, and other text documents.

i)
Numerical data refers to the data that is in the form of numbers, and not in any language or descriptive form.
Categorical data is a type of data that is used to group information with similar characteristics.
ii)
Feature selection is simply selecting and excluding given features without changing them. Dimensionality reduction transforms features into a lower dimension.

4)
i)
Histogram is a graphical representation that organizes a group of data points into user-specified ranges.in appearance to a bar graph, the histogram condenses a data series into an easily visual by taking many data points and grouping them into logical ranges or bins.
ii)
A scatter plot is a chart type that is normally used to observe and visually display the relationship between variables.the values of the variables are represented by dots.the positioning of the dots on the vertical and horizontal axis will inform the value of the respective data point.hence,scatter plots make use of Cartesian coordinates to display the values of the variables in a data set.

5)
quantitative data gets you the numbers to prove the broad general points of your research. Qualitative data brings you the details and the depth to understand their full implications.hence to get the best result it is necessary to investigate.

6)
#shapes of histogram
-bell-shaped
-bimodal
-skewed right
-skewed left
-uniform
-random
#Bins
A histogram displays numerical data by grouping data into "bins" of equal width.each bin is plotted as a bar whose height corresponds to how many data points are in that bin.bins are also sometimes called intervals,classes.

7)
different ways to deal with outliers-
-remove or change the outliers during post-test analysis.
-we can change the value of outliers.
-consider the underlying distribution.

8)
mean,median,mode are the central inclination measures.
because mean is the average of a set of data and the median is the middle value of the arranged set of data.

9)
The scatter plot is a fundamental tool for looking at bivariate data.it shows the important characteristics of the data and can be used to decide what model may describe the relationship between the variables.also it is possible to find a outliers using scatter plot.

10)
To describe the relationship between two categorical variables,we use a special type of table called a cross-tabulation. in this,the categories of one variable determine the rows of the table and the categories of the other variable determine the columns.
