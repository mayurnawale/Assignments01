1)
It is a technique,which groups the unlabelled dataset.it can be defined as,a way of grouping the data points into different clusters,consisting of similar data points. It is often used as a data analysis technique for discovering interesting patterns in data,such as group of customers based on their behaviour.
    
different algorithm:
-k means clustering
-hierarchical clustering algorithm
-fuzzy c means algorithm
-mean shift clustering
-density based spatial clustering
-gaussian mixed models
    
2)
Clustering algorithm applications:
-Market research and customer segmentation
-biological data and medical imaging
-search result clustering
-recommendation engine
-pattern recognition
-social network analysis
-image processing

3)
K means clustering algorithm can be significantly improved by using a better initialization technique,and by repeating (re-starting) the algorithm.when the data has overlapping clusters , K-means can improve the results of the initialization technique.
    
4)
Backpropagation is an important mathematical tool for improving the accuracy of predictions in data mining and machine learning.Essentially backpropagation is an algorithm used to calculate derivatives quickly.
The backpropogation algorithm work by computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight by the chain rule,computing the gradient one layer at a time,iteratig backword from the last layer to avoid redundant calculations of intermediate terms in the chain rule.
    
5)
The most commonly used algorithm in clustering are partitioning,hierarchical,grid based,density based and model based algorithms.a review of clustering and its different techniques in data mining is done considering the criteria's for big data.
    
6)
In constructivist learning,the traditional classroom learning procedure is flipped.instead of a teacher informing a child about a subject and constructing a meaning for them,in constrictivist learning children construct their own meaning.now this may not be the best approach for every learning environment,but it can be tremendously helpful at home.the home environment is where children primarily develope a sense of self and is the perfect setting for a children to practice taking initiative in their learning via a constructivist approach.

7)
Anomaly detection is a technique of identifying rare events or observations which can raise suspicions by being statistically different from the rest of the observations.where as in novelty detection you have a data set that contains only good data and you are trying to determine wheather new observations fit within the exsting data set.

8)
A Gaussian mixture is a function that is comprised of several Gaussians,each indentified by k ∈ {1,…, K},where k is the number of clusters of our datset.Each Gaussian k in the mixture is comprised of the following parameters:A mean μ that defines its centre.A covariance Σ that defines its width.
    
9)
An approach is to find the clusters using soft clustering methods and then see if they are gaussian.if they are then you can apply a GMM model which represents the whole dataset.
