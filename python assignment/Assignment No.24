1)
  lambda returns a value that can optionally be assigned a name.whereas the def statement always assigns the new function to the name in the header, instead of returning value. lambda's body is a single expression, not a block of statements.

2)
-They can be used whenever function objects are required.
-they provides shortcut for declaring small functions.
-they behave just like regular functions.

3)
  map creates a new array by transforming every element in an array.
  filter creates a new array by removing elements that don't belong.
  reduce takes all of the elements in an array and reduces them into a single value.

4)
  Function annotations provide a way of associating various parts of a function with arbitrary python expressions at compile time.

5)
  recursive functions is a process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly.it is used to solving problems that can be broken down into smaller problems.

6)
general guidelines for coding functions.
-limited use of globals.
-Use 4-space indentation and no tabs.
-standard headers for different modules.
-Use docstrings bcoz there are both single and multiline docstrings that can be used in Python.
-Wrap lines so that they don't exceed 79 characters,the Python standard library is conservative and requires limiting lines to 79 characters.

7)
-return():
-def():
-print():
-myFun():
