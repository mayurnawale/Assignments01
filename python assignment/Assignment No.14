  Import the image module from the Pillow library from PIL import Image,Open any image and get the RAGBAG values.img =Image.open('image.png') & rgba =img.convert(“RGBA”)Change the color,data will be an imaging Core object containing thousands of tuples of RGBA values and finally store the changed image.

4)
  at first create an empty Markdown cell,then drag-and-drop the image file into the empty Markdown cell and then

  print(width, height)

5)
   the resize() method to resize the image.
6)
  save() saves this image under the given filename,if no format is specified then the format to use is determined from the filename extension.

7)
  ImageDraw=Pillow provides a drawing module called ImageDraw that can use to create simple 2D graphics on our Image objects.

8)
  GeometryDrawing=Draws a shape.
  ImageDrawing=Draws an image
  VideoDrawing=Plays an audio or video file
  DrawingGroup=Draws other drawings,use a drawing group to combine other drawings into a single composite drawing.
