1)
A class is a set of entities which are better known as instances. It is a one-to-one partnership
# a and b are distinct instances of the list class/type
# they contain the same sequence of integers
>>> a = list((1, 2, 3))
>>> b = list((1, 2, 3))
>>> a is b
False


>>> isinstance(a, list)
True


>>> isinstance(b, list)
True


2)
Classes and variables


3)
Class stores the data/values of objects.


4)
Both are called by name; Method is a piece of code and associated with an object, whereas regular function is not.


5)
Yes,its the ability of one class to replicate the properties from another class
     __init__


6)
Encapsulation works on class variables by wrapping them and declaring them private.


7)
Class variable has the same value for all instances of the class and instance variable has different values for all instances of a class.


8)
when there is need to access the class, then class method helps to create instances of such class.


9)
when two objects have same method __add__ method is used and if not then __radd__  is used to check if values can be added.


10)
It is used to support concatenation and slicing for strings, lists and sequences by writing a recursive reverse function.


11)
Emulting numeric type


12)
Yes,to customize instance variable add double underscores before its name.
