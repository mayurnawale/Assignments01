1)
It helps to plot out all the different outcomes of an experiment. 
Adding all the probabilities helps predict a range.


2)
Random numbers use unpredictable physical means to generate numbers and Pseudo-random numbers use mathematical algorithms.
Pseudo- Random numbers produces sequences of random numbers based on a algorithm and thus are not predictable thus more preferred.


3) 
Mean and standard deviation


4)
Tossing a coin


5)
The short term results can be vague and include multiple factors.
As number of trials grow the probability of success increases and gets closer to a normal distribution.


6)
lists


7)
Functions are classified by the type of mathematical equation which represents their relationship.Some functions are algebraic.Other functions like f(x) = sin x, deal with angles and are known as trigonometric.Still other functions have logarithmic and exponential relationships and are classified. 


8)
Logarithmic functions are always inverses of exponential functions.


9)
log(a,(Base))
log2(a)
log10(a)
