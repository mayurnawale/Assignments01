1)
  the checked exception
  the error
  the runtime exception.

2)
 If an exception is not caught,then the runtime system will abort the program (i.e. crash) and an exception message will print to the console.

3)
  Try and except statements are used to catch and handle exceptions in Python.statements that can raise exceptions are kept inside the try clause and the statements that handle the exception are written inside except clause.

4)
  Try – This method catches the exceptions raised by the program.
  Raise – Triggers an exception manually using custom exceptions.

5)
  python uses try and except keywords to handle exceptions.both keywords are followed by indented blocks.
  The try block contains one or more statements which are likely to encounter an exception.if the statements in this block are executed without an exception,the subsequent except block is skipped.
