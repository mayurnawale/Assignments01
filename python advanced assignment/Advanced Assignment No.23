numpy.histogram() is the built in function used.

4)
We can use figure(figsize==(10,8)) function inside the matplot.pyplot library which we scale down or up the graph.

5)
in regular multiplication values of same index get multiplied.
in dot product there is row wise multiplication,row of one array with column of second array and so on.
in outer multiplication every element of first array a1 will be multiply by every element of other arrat a2 such the number of columns will be equal to the number of element in another array a2.

-rate=the periodic interest rate.
-nper=the number of payment period.
