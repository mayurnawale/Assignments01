1)
  When a class is derived from more than one base class it is called multiple Inheritance. The derived class inherits all the features of the base case.

2)
  Delegation is an object oriented technique it is also called a design pattern.it gives the time and ability to focus on higher-level tasks.
  
3)
  Composition is a concept that models has a relationship.It enables creating complex types by combining objects of other types,it means that a class composite can contain an object of another class component.

4)
  A bound method is the one which is dependent on the instance of the class as the first argument.it passes the instance as the first argument which is used to access the variables and functions.after python 3 and newer versions all the functions in the class are by default bound methods.

5)
  Pseudoprivate attributes are useful in larger frameworks,tools both to avoid introducing new method names that might accidentally hide definitions elsewhere in the class tree,also to reduce the chance of internal methods being replaced by names defined lower in the the tree.
