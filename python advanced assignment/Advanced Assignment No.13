1)
Yes, there are no repercussions as long as it is in sequence

2)
You can use an array or use a list slice command.
a = [1]*1000
 
3)
by using l[::n]
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]
L[1:::2]
Starting from one it will slice every 2nd odd number.

4)
indexing- used as a resource to obtain individual elements and slicing is used to obtain a sequence of those elements.

5)
Python will generate an error and simply return an empty sequence.

6)
Create a mutable list type with indexing that can be later reassigned new value. List indexing: We use the index number of a list item to modify the value associated with that item. If you want to replace one value in a list, the indexing syntax is most appropriate. To replace multiple items in a list that meet a criterion, using list comprehension is a good solution. 

7)
A matrix is unbalanced if all cells in the matrix are unbalanced and a cell of the matrix is unbalanced if the number of cells in that matrix that are adjacent to that cell is strictly lesser than the value written in this cell. 
Adjacent cell means cells in the top, down, left, and right cell of each cell if it exists. 

8)
It helps to build the code more readable and help understand how it works. 
List comprehension is fast effective and requires much less effort.
