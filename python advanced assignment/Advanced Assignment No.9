1)
  int , float , complex : the numerical types.
bool : the boolean type. True and False are the only boolean-type objects.
NoneType : the “null” type; None is the only object that belongs to this type.
str : the string type.
list : the list type.

2)
  capitalize()=Converts the first character to upper case
casefold()=Converts string into lower case
center()=Returns a centered string
count()=Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a string

3)
  To allow working with non-ascii Unicode characters,In Python 3.X has a unicode type which is a collection of Unicode code points. The line ustring = u'A unicode \u018e string \xf1' creates a Unicode string with 20 characters.

4)
  While both binary and text files contain data stored as a series of bits (binary values of 1s and 0s), the bits in text files represent characters, while the bits in binary files represent custom data. Binary files typically contain a sequence of bytes, or ordered groupings of eight bits.

5)
  decode() is a method specified in Strings in Python 2. This method is used to convert from one encoding scheme, in which argument string is encoded to the desired encoding scheme. This works opposite to the encode. It accepts the encoding of the encoding string to decode it and returns the original string.

6)
  write() to write unicode text to a text file. Call str. encode(encoding) with encoding set to "utf8" to encode str . Call open(file, mode) to open a file with mode set to "wb".


7)
  UTF-8 encodes each of these characters with a single byte, any ASCII text is also a UTF-8 text. Unicode is a superset of ASCII.

8)
  They are stored internally as a Unicode sequence with a know codec. That means that they are a sequence of bytes where each character might be one, two, three or four bytes depending on which Unicode page this characters are from.
